Crawling Machine Learning/ Artificial Intelligence papers by category

## Machine Learning and Learning Theory
```bash
python neurips-icml-iclr.py # ML conference: NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR
python proceedings_ml.py # PMLR/ JMLR/ DMLR/ TMLR/ MLOSS: https://proceedings.mlr.press/ and proceedings of other ML conferences
```

## Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics
```bash
python nlp.py # cover most of NLP conferences/ journals: https://aclanthology.org/events/
```

## Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
```bash
python computer_vision.py # cover CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and other CV conferences
```

## Artificial Intelligence
```bash

```

## Data Mining and Information Retrieval

## Arxiv Sanity Lite and Arxiv
Python program for crawling AI/ ML papers from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [arXiv-Sanity-Lite](https://arxiv-sanity-lite.com/).
```bash
python arxiv-org.py
python arxiv-sanity-lite.py
```

In `arXiv` you should define the type of field that you want to discover. For example: Machine Learning appears in both (`cs.LG` and `stat.ML`)

Table define list of fields
|No. | Abv | Group | Field |
|-|-|-|-|
|1| cs.LG | Computer Science | Machine Learning |
|2| stat.ML | Statistics | Machine Learning |
```bash
python arxiv-sanity-lite.py # cover abstracts, title, authors, and links to the papers
python arxiv-org.py # cover title, authors, and links to the papers by category
```
