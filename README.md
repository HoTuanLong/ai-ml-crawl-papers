Python program for crawling AI/ ML papers from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [arXiv-Sanity-Lite](https://arxiv-sanity-lite.com/).
Additional resources will be added later (conferences and journals)

```bash
python arxiv-org.py
python arxiv-sanity-lite.py
```

In `arXiv` you should define the type of field that you want to discover. For example: Machine Learning appears in both (`cs.LG` and `stat.ML`)

Table define list of fields
|No. | Abv | Group | Field |
|-|-|-|-|
|1| cs.LG | Computer Science | Machine Learning |
|2| stat.ML | Statistics | Machine Learning |
